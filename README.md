ðŸŒŸ Exciting First Steps in My Data Analyst Journey! ðŸŒŸ
I'm thrilled to share that I've officially started my first project at Codveda as a Data Analyst Intern! ðŸš€
My first challenge? Working with the Iris dataset (iris.csv), which contains key attributes like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and species. This dataset is a classic in machine learning and data science, and I'm eager to explore patterns and insights within it!
To document my learning journey, I've set up a GitHub repository, where I'll be sharing my progress, analyses, and insights along the way. Stay tuned for updates!
A big thank you to Codveda for this incredible opportunityâ€”I'm excited to grow, learn, and contribute!
Feel free to connect, share advice, or even collaborate! ðŸš€
